# BeestProtocol

**Build the rails. Fund the future.**

BeestProtocol is an open-source, decentralized blockchain protocol that aims to become the infrastructure backbone for crypto transactions—cross-chain, trustless, and frictionless. Inspired by Linus Torvalds and the Linux movement, BeestProtocol is designed to become the *Linux kernel* of crypto payments: minimal, extensible, and unowned.

## 🔭 Vision

To replace gatekeeping financial middlemen (Visa, PayPal, brokers, realtors) with a transparent, decentralized protocol that allows **anyone to transact any crypto, any chain, any time.** Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or the next great token—you should be able to move value without permission.
